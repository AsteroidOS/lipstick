building / dependencies
=======================

check the specfile in the 'rpm' directory. or just use mb2 to build.

how to run lipstick
===================

1. Build lipstick.
2. Install lipstick.
3. Get yourself a desktop
   If you haven't got anything better to use, grab the example
   (http://github.com/nemomobile/lipstick-example-home/).

   Build according to instructions, and run it.

   Desktops use both the plugin and shared library generally, so 
   both of them should be intact before you can run the example
   
   NOTE: if you use a properly packaged version of the library,
   you won't need to go through this trouble
