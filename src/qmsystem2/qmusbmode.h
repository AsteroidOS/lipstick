/*!
 * @scope Internal
 * @brief Provides a way to set and get the mode of the USB (Universal Serial Bus) on the device.
 *
 * When the USB state is changed, the modeChanged signal is emitted.
 * First, when the USB cable is plugged in, the QmUSBMode::Connected mode is signaled.
 * If there is a default USB mode other than QmUSBMode::Ask set, it will be the next USB mode.
 * Otherwise, QmUSBMode::ModeRequest is emitted, for which one should respond by calling setMode(QmUSBMode::Mode).
 * If no USB mode is set in 30 seconds, the USB mode will be set to QmUSBMode::ChargingOnly.
 *
 * The USB state can be also set by calling setMode(QmUSBMode::Mode).
 *
 * Typically, the default mode is either set to QmUSBMode::OviSuite or QmUSBMode::MassStorage, which is then
 * used when the USB cable is plugged in. The other option is to set the default mode to QmUSBMode::Ask,
 * listen for the QmUSBMode::ModeRequest mode, and then set the QmUSBMode::MassStorage or QmUSBMode::OviSuite mode.
 *
 * Switching the USB mode from QmUSBMode::MassStorage to QmUSBMode::OviSuite (and vice versa) is not supported
 * without re-plugging the USB cable.
